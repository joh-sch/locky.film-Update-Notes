### Video Project Laurels

They are displayed in the preview video overlay, togehter with the project artist and title (fade in when the mouse enters a video project element).
Each laurel is displayed for 3 seconds after which it fades out

#### How to add & configure a laurel

0. Switch on a video projectâ€™s _Laurel_ toggle field.

1. Set the laurel position, width and file field.

A laurel can be positioned in the video elementâ€™s corners (top left/right, bottom left/right) or centered along the elementâ€™s bottom edge.

Because the laurel images come with different aspect ratios and different levels of detail (some are more intricate than others), it would be
difficult to find a uniform width that works well for all of them (meaning a width that looks good/balanced in relation to the rest of the
site design while also being legible). Hence the width can be gradually adjusted to a value between 10 and 30. The default value is 15, which worked
well for some laurels during testing. Trust your own judgment here and do a couple of tests to find a good size.

2. A note on the laurel image files

For a consistent placement/layout of the laurels it will be helpful if the laurel image files themselves have
no extra spacing/whitespace around the actual laurel graphic. Any extra spacing included in the file cannot be controlled via code and will be
added to the laurel when it is displayed on top of the preview video and thereby set off spacing intended in the code. If possible, please try
to get files without any extra spacing. In cases where this isnâ€™t possible, feel free to reach out and I can remove the spacing for you.
